             OAuth 2.0 for First-Party Native Applications
           draft-parecki-oauth-first-party-native-apps-latest

Abstract

   This document extends the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework [RFC6749]
   with new grant types to support first-party native applications that
   want to control the user experience of the process of obtaining
   authorization from the user.

   In many cases, this can provide an entirely browserless experience
   suited for native applications, only delegating to the browser in
   unexpected, high risk, or error conditions.

   While a fully-delegated approach using the redirect-based
   Authorization Code grant is generally preferred, this draft provides
   a mechanism for the client to directly interact with the user.  This
   requires a high degree of trust between the authorization server and
   the client, as there typically is for first-party applications.  It
   should only be considered when there are usability concerns with a
   redirect-based approach, such as for native mobile or desktop
   applications.
